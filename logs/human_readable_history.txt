[19:47:37.517] the window
[19:47:37.825] changes
[19:47:38.461] have
[19:47:39.133] to be in

[19:49:18.260] happen
[19:49:18.573] first
[19:49:21.140] but I'll keep
[19:49:21.938] that on
[19:49:24.470] and there's gotta be like
[19:49:25.320] a little alarm or something
[19:49:26.418] if
[19:49:31.215] the cursor is somewhere else
[19:49:31.977] basically
[19:49:33.581] for more than
[19:49:34.352] like
[19:49:35.680] twelve seconds
[19:49:40.115] what am I doing
[19:49:41.590] I'm doing
[19:49:42.152] da vinci
[19:50:28.657] but still
[19:50:29.663] a question here would be
[19:50:29.972] be
[19:50:30.766] yeah
[19:50:31.088] OK
[19:50:31.467] good
[19:50:31.831] it's
[19:50:32.317] it's logging
[19:50:34.822] I guess
[19:50:36.101] i'm just gonna do this
[19:50:38.251] and
[19:50:38.640] put
[19:50:39.236] the
[19:50:42.731] video
[19:50:43.504] of maine doing this
[19:50:45.937] and
[19:50:51.201] edit it
[19:50:52.899] yeah
[19:50:54.639] yeah
[19:50:55.413] you just Edit it
[19:50:58.117] and maybe you throw in like some better ones but
[19:50:59.738] youuld
[19:51:03.406] uld do that and then you make the reclaiming joy
[19:51:05.235] thing
[19:51:07.459] yeah
[19:51:08.502] I feel like
[19:51:16.336] yeah I guess
[19:51:16.838] so
[19:51:18.440] I feel like I'm really about to
[19:51:18.791] just
[19:51:19.797] freaking Chill out
[19:51:20.883] Chill
[19:51:30.546] enjoy it for whatever it ends up being
[19:51:52.134] OK that's cool
[19:51:58.760] Oh
[20:00:45.539] OK
[20:00:46.061] yeah this is fine
[20:00:46.852] and
[20:00:47.161] it
[20:00:48.103] also basically should
[20:00:49.744] make sure that
[20:00:52.616] man 'cause we could do
[20:00:53.906] we could just do reports
[20:00:55.804] we could put
[20:00:57.138] a whole day ofis
[20:01:00.020] his into
[20:01:00.846] a
[20:01:02.721] summarizer and it could go back.
[20:01:03.583] oh the other
[20:01:04.263] I was saying
[20:01:04.572] was
[20:01:05.356] if
[20:01:05.661] you
[20:01:12.796] made something to ask a question right you could do for one version hit the Gemini
[20:01:14.493] um just make a new tab
[20:01:15.758] in brave and
[20:01:17.255] ask the question there in gemini
[20:01:19.830] or
[20:01:21.081] you could tamper script
[20:01:23.608] into one of the gemini things
[20:01:26.633] but then you could also
[20:01:26.993] make
[20:01:27.550] it
[20:01:28.181] you can make
[20:01:28.586] it
[20:01:29.148] hit
[20:01:31.353] comfy UI or something
[20:01:39.050] g at your your AI work station so you can just asset you actually don't even need
[20:01:40.461] yeah
[20:01:41.427] somebody
[20:01:41.764] else
[20:01:42.437] 's model
[20:01:42.980] right
[20:01:45.382] don't even need somebody else
[20:01:46.292] 's model so yeah
[20:01:49.553] h you could just ask it and hopefully it would tell you
[20:01:52.268] yeah
[20:02:11.243] it would just be the same thing
[20:02:15.357] and
[20:02:16.342] maybe
[20:02:20.349] that back end processing
[20:02:24.024] put this
[20:02:34.443] and
[20:02:38.884] does it need to be in a docker cont
[20:02:40.826] I don't know
[20:02:41.256] it's
[20:02:41.930] pretty simple
[20:02:46.894] OK I talk a lot
[20:02:51.387] OK so we have all this
[20:02:52.769] we're putting it together
[20:02:54.521] we
[20:03:02.535] umm
[20:03:03.420] yeah
[20:03:04.480] I guess I gotta stand stand
[20:03:05.344] this
[20:05:42.763] umm umm umm
[20:05:44.021] ummmmummWe umm
[20:05:44.712] umm
[20:05:45.333] umm
[20:05:46.943] m
[20:05:48.106] e ummm
[20:05:50.262] mme umm
[20:05:50.943] ummmumm
[20:05:51.392] to text Hebrew
[20:05:59.362] so I'll try and say that
[20:05:59.801] again
[20:06:00.539] if you say
[20:06:01.078] shema
[20:06:02.652] it will turn on
[20:06:03.258] the
[20:06:06.413] will have like some local model
[20:06:07.469] to do voice to text
[20:06:09.762] for hebrew
[20:06:12.996] and
[20:06:13.610] so
[20:06:14.903] if
[20:06:15.805] you say a word
[20:06:17.876] and
[20:06:18.533] it takes it
[20:06:18.906] and
[20:06:20.103] says oh I think it's this word
[20:06:22.878] then you get like a green
[20:06:24.305] if
[20:06:24.970] it ISN't
[20:06:25.454] very confident
[20:06:26.652] you get like a yellow
[20:06:28.490] and
[20:06:31.788] if
[20:06:32.492] there's a
[20:06:33.361] you know if there's a
[20:06:34.527] PAuse in your speech
[20:06:35.417] then
[20:06:36.401] it just turns back
[20:06:39.595] ck off and that way you can do really low
[20:06:41.628] MLE usage
[20:06:47.006] OK
[20:07:48.649] ge usagesageagegesageage
[20:07:49.408] sageage usageusage
[20:07:49.899] sage
[20:07:59.329] I wanna see if I can do visual indicators and
[20:08:00.446] sound indicators
[20:08:04.707] when
[20:08:05.159] it responds
[20:08:06.334] when
[20:08:07.573] when like that's a communication thing
[20:08:08.728] it doesn't have toeak
[20:08:12.810] eak words it can just say notifications.
[20:08:16.293] so yeah
[20:08:17.230] you can have that
[20:08:17.828] and
[20:08:26.620] habits
[20:08:27.408] in the Earth
[20:08:30.087] oh yeah you would really need to see if
[20:08:32.176] the current
[20:08:33.207] way you're doing it
[20:08:33.716] allows
[20:08:34.347] for
[20:08:36.983] transparent
[20:08:40.159] like draw over
[20:08:47.416] .
[20:08:51.863] I feel like that should be a thing right
[20:09:09.336] and then can go around this one
[20:09:16.613] and
[20:09:17.591] then that one should just
[20:09:17.937] be
[20:09:18.305] oh my
[20:09:21.033] my brain is just popping
[20:09:21.412] these days

[20:10:02.829] s
[20:10:24.487] yeah I don't even know what I was going to say
[20:10:26.259] it does feel like my brain isg
[20:10:48.884] daysysdaysese daysays daysyse days
[20:10:49.425] daysdayse days
[20:10:57.556] what's interesting
[20:10:58.887] is I could probably store
[20:11:01.622] da vinci
[20:11:02.073] data
[20:11:02.773] on a
[20:11:03.149] different
[20:11:05.334] computer
[20:11:05.745] that would be
[20:11:06.105] nice
[20:11:07.269] .
[20:11:10.643] .
[20:17:09.171] there's so much happening right now
[20:17:09.872] .
[20:17:11.193] Like
[20:17:14.549] maybe every
[20:17:15.547] day
[20:17:16.171] you
[20:17:16.542] program
[20:17:16.932] matically send
[20:17:17.476] this
[20:17:17.901] to yourself
[20:17:18.538] as like
[20:17:20.941] here
[20:17:22.960] are
[20:17:29.918] yeah you have to put it
[20:17:31.539] into some kind of prompt and then
[20:17:32.619] it sends yourselfry
[20:17:34.315] verything you were talking about yesterday.
[20:17:37.227] so
[20:17:37.598] I think
[20:17:38.554] my current thing is
[20:17:39.166] like
[20:17:41.956] how can I how can I make this functional
[20:17:44.130] so that was like actually useful.
[20:17:51.352] 'cause I kinda wanna do everything on this
[20:17:55.682] and I feel like I could
[20:17:56.957] so yeah
[20:18:27.566] yeah
[20:18:33.601] look at what I have been building
[20:18:40.078] so
[20:18:41.624] what all do I want to get done today
[20:18:46.564] I
[20:18:47.300] want to
[20:18:55.990] OK seriously
[20:18:58.799] what all do I want to get done today I want to do the
[20:19:02.684] I want to do the instagram post
[20:19:03.887] I
[20:19:04.572] want to
[20:19:08.860] how else
[20:19:10.647] instagram post
[20:19:12.694] I wanna
[20:19:14.861] and the instagram post
[20:19:15.549] has
[20:19:17.311] an edited video in it and it has
[20:19:18.612] a littleg
[20:19:20.410] thing about
[20:19:21.306] reclaiming joy
[20:19:21.809] twenty twenty six
[20:19:28.350] but I also
[20:19:28.971] want to get
[20:19:29.832] this
[20:19:30.445] thing like
[20:19:31.894] actually functional because it's like
[20:19:34.641] hilariously
[20:19:35.729] almost borderline functional
[20:19:36.261] .
[20:19:57.973] hop
[20:20:02.636] maybe
[20:20:03.089] just put it
[20:20:03.558] in
[20:20:05.678] the bottom left
[20:20:09.554] at the top right
[20:20:12.527] I'll put in the top right
[20:20:17.078] I was just
[20:20:17.672] this it
[20:20:18.451] 's a full screen
[20:20:19.960] OK
[20:20:32.957] what else gemini if there's a way to make
[20:20:33.953] a TK
[20:20:35.544] enter or browser window
[20:20:36.508] window
[20:20:50.727] like the other one I have but transparent background. And I want to have the whole full screen and my input field in the top right and everything else transparent so I can see what's under the window.
[20:20:53.307] is that Possible
[20:20:53.958] question
[20:20:57.985] the other thing
[20:20:58.719] I wanna do
[20:20:59.266] is
[20:21:00.216] get this transcription
[20:21:00.748] thing going
[20:24:39.688] oh that's what I was trying to do I was trying to find

[20:28:47.115] might need a different

[20:29:03.782] see what gemini has to say

[20:29:29.513] it's the background
[20:29:30.476] is

[20:29:52.236] gaming

[20:30:05.304] happen

[21:12:32.062] Is literally perfect and whenever you click in there it should also start the recording if it's not recorded sick dude we're doing it I really hope this is logging correctly it's fine it doesn't even you just figure out the data schema right we're live we're hearing we're talking OK now I feel like I would want to I don't think it should I don't think I should print like this It's going to end up being very it doesn't matter So those are transcripts and yeah then I would probably want to do this thing and then I think it would be Shema Gemini and what that would do would be bring  It would bring a browser with the thing a browser bring a browser to the front and then it would open just a completely new Gemini with a new chat and then it would put the it would put the cursor in the Gemini and then Or it could just record everything after Gemini and then when you say ? It sends yeah OK that seems like it would be simple It would be a it would be a switch statement right oh I could just copy all of this It would be a switch statement for different words so always Shema shema is always the one that like triggers the switch statement but one of the words should be Gemini one should be I'm sorry for I forget the Hebrew word for true no tree  And it's and it and it's so it's would be another command it's Shima Adez would be another one you could do  But yeah basically if I have it and then I can maybe film myself  Editing and using this thing   Or you could say something like Gemini Rewind Shima Gemini Shuv and it would kind of go back and it would Shema Gemini Shuv 5 minutes something like that and it would summarize what you were talking about for the last 5 minutes That's funny   Yeah I also need to make the the notification that goes off if it's off I also need to make something that just listens to see whether or not the Microsoft Transcription app is recording and if it's been more than 12 seconds then it sends out a notification.   'cause I just want that on I want it making noise saying things umm QQ well just it shoots you It's like a Sam's Beam sound it shoots you Umm yeah and then if you click it it gives you a satisfying notification  If you click on the Oh yeah if you if you start the recording once you start the recording then it will give you a nice notification so we can find some of those .  Do you need that right now I kinda do 'cause I keep forgetting Just solve it once Oh yeah dude I wrote like a voice command I got Jarvis for myself  OK we have to do it yeah  ThThey come so fast and then they go man there's so many that I lose it's sad  It's kind of we got alright it's on it's listening Yeah  We are making something right Yeah you is will be like what would you call this Wherever it clicks it should yeah Huh so interesting because you want this Hey there Alright cool i'm good with that Umm OK the reason I am doing this is so I will stop on text changed

[15:52:23.701] Incredible
[15:52:35.376] So it's cool that it can record me, but I want it to be able to do commands for me
[15:52:48.008] so I need some sort of trigger word to make sure that it starts paying attention to what I say
[15:53:00.905] I'm really into Hebrew, so the trigger word I'm going to use is Shema it means listen and when I stop talking we're probably going to see a small print at the bottom of the page
