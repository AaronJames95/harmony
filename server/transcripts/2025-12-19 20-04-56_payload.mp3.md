**[00:00:00]**  okay there's more if I already know what I want to do if I think the  
**[00:00:30]**  yeah I don't know yeah just accepting what is it God I'm done I don't want to  
**[00:00:41]**  drive this plane car anymore and every oh my gosh that's hilarious  
**[00:00:52]**  but yeah I think like I don't really feel like I fit in in the city as a dude  
**[00:01:09]**  and I think that's probably just what life is gonna be like for me  
**[00:01:14]**  this is this is just what it is it's like  
**[00:01:28]**  but I am being long I think honestly I don't know for sure  
**[00:01:35]**  I know I played so I think it's it's it's it's I played so much Super Smash  
**[00:01:55]**  Brothers Melee I could do that I can make a trainer that change you're gonna  
**[00:01:59]**  play that game better bro I I I could you not like I don't know if that causes  
**[00:02:12]**  ready damage but it might be interesting to just double check we'll just make  
**[00:02:20]**  sure we'll just you know just for what are they call it skips and wiggles yeah  
**[00:02:29]**  oh my god yeah yeah yeah I think you could do it and it could just it could  
**[00:02:45]**  not just be for music it could be for like gaming right so I could just like  
**[00:02:51]**  do that and I could actually even like stream it and make it an event to follow  
**[00:02:57]**  as I do it so like literally I literally don't know when we got you know  
**[00:03:10]**  oh seven eight all right that's spooky they can just put something like that so  
**[00:03:21]**  deep in our children that's very spooky  
**[00:03:31]**  I think  
**[00:03:34]**  nah nah  
**[00:03:43]**  the issue is the issue is not like is it is it gonna kill us or is it gonna make  
**[00:03:55]**  the world into utopia it's not what the question is the question is how are you  
**[00:04:08]**  how are you  
**[00:04:12]**  yeah how are you oh man I get it hi Anna I think that would be  
**[00:04:42]**  that we surrender surrender  
**[00:04:49]**  surrender might be giving up on like perfect foreign sobriety in favor to  
**[00:04:59]**  fight a more important battle right now I think I have a more important  
**[00:05:05]**  financial battle right now to be fighting and to force myself to stop  
**[00:05:10]**  doing the porn I think when I get some space in my life then I can do that and  
**[00:05:16]**  I would approach it with hopefully the same intensity as I'm about to approach  
**[00:05:20]**  this but I think when I fight multiple battles at the same time that's not good  
**[00:05:24]**  for me and and people I think it's possible that people might come to rely  
**[00:05:32]**  on me people do rely on me actually as an after-school teacher it's weird to be so  
**[00:05:40]**  familiar with the product like and I'm not like whatever spin that however you  
**[00:05:50]**  want people spin it spin it spin it he said this spin it he said that what I  
**[00:05:55]**  meant what I meant when I said that was like I've only been in jobs where that  
**[00:06:06]**  my impact is so so so so so far away from me that like I really can't grasp  
**[00:06:13]**  how I'm helping at all and it's hard for me to like lock it into jobs like that  
**[00:06:18]**  where I just like don't get it but like why like but like but like why but like  
**[00:06:27]**  like if you  
**[00:06:57]**  you  
**[00:07:27]**  I can literally just pick up a Bible is insane.  
**[00:07:43]**  Do you know what this thing is?  
**[00:07:44]**  Do you know how absurd it is?  
**[00:07:47]**  Impossible.  
**[00:07:48]**  How much of a historically unlikely possibility it is that something like what this is exists?  
**[00:07:56]**  Like look at it for like it's how exceptional it is.  
**[00:08:01]**  Believe it.  
**[00:08:02]**  Don't believe it.  
**[00:08:03]**  You know what?  
**[00:08:06]**  Look, bro, the problem is.  
**[00:08:15]**  Yeah, and I lose it.  
**[00:08:24]**  It's not it's.  
**[00:08:35]**  It's not me.  
**[00:08:44]**  I don't know.  
**[00:08:45]**  Maybe just having like a really high narcissism or something, or just like, oh, it's just  
**[00:08:53]**  like, I really think it's all about me.  
**[00:08:58]**  So, you know, there's always.  
**[00:09:03]**  There's always pieces coming off.  
**[00:09:09]**  Oh, my goodness.  
**[00:09:11]**  Oh, the piece is coming off.  
**[00:09:20]**  And then ideally, these types of people are just so enjoyable to be around.  
**[00:09:26]**  Oh, my gosh.  
**[00:09:27]**  How have you been doing a bad job of that?  
**[00:09:31]**  I don't think I've been very good at doing that at all.  
**[00:09:35]**  I'm getting it.  
**[00:09:36]**  I'm starting to see a guy gave me this idea of like the ML stuff.  
**[00:09:41]**  So I like to feel like it came out over.  
**[00:09:45]**  And so, OK, right.  
**[00:09:47]**  So like, I'll say what it feels like.  
**[00:09:49]**  It feels like it came out over.  
**[00:09:52]**  It feels like that's crazy.  
**[00:09:54]**  How did where did that idea come from?  
**[00:09:56]**  And it fits so well with what I want to do.  
**[00:10:02]**  That's how it feels.  
**[00:10:03]**  And I feel like that's what the reality is for me.  
**[00:10:06]**  When I see something like that, I don't go, oh, what a crazy thing.  
**[00:10:10]**  I'm never going to think about it again.  
**[00:10:12]**  I think. Is it possible that this that this could be God doing something?  
**[00:10:18]**  And it's called faith and faith because you don't always get it right.  
**[00:10:23]**  Because we're still learning God.  
**[00:10:25]**  God is very you thought he was here, but then now he's over there.  
**[00:10:29]**  And then you thought he was all like this.  
**[00:10:32]**  And then he's like, then he thought he was like this.  
**[00:10:34]**  And then and then you you realize he was like, if I could do a sad face, I would do it.  
**[00:10:42]**  I just like weeping.  
**[00:10:46]**  Yeah, I think I think that's how God is feeling right now.  
**[00:10:52]**  That's what I would say. I think God is crying right now.  
**[00:10:56]**  Oh, man.  
**[00:11:01]**  It's just so sad.  
**[00:11:07]**  It's not from a perspective of, oh, the people are going to leave me.  
**[00:11:11]**  I think it's more of a.  
**[00:11:14]**  I think God actually loves people and I need to be.  
**[00:11:20]**  This is a very different thing between the American concept of love and the Hebrew concept of chess.  
**[00:11:27]**  It's different. It's not the same thing.  
**[00:11:30]**  I know you think it's the same thing, but it's actually not the same thing.  
**[00:11:33]**  And you should just check what it actually is.  
**[00:11:37]**  That's it.  
**[00:11:40]**  If that is the if that is how the most powerful being in reality feels about me.  
**[00:11:46]**  I can let go. I can trust I can trust that.  
**[00:11:52]**  Here you go.  
**[00:11:55]**  Take this, whatever is left of the rest of this.  
**[00:12:04]**  It's the you know, I felt like just the the the circumcision of it.  
**[00:12:12]**  It hurts.  
**[00:12:16]**  It's not.  
**[00:12:21]**  It's expensive.  
**[00:12:27]**  I'm grateful.  
**[00:12:29]**  And it's expensive.  
**[00:12:43]**  Wow.  
**[00:12:45]**  But if this is what this is, is just finding some way to find myself doing, you know, being in New York and doing A.I. and vocals training thing.  
**[00:12:59]**  I would just want to do that. And I don't need I think that's right where I'm trying to finally try to get to.  
**[00:13:05]**  Oh, that's me. Hi, this is me.  
**[00:13:07]**  This is Aaron. This is actually what I'm like when I'm normal.  
**[00:13:10]**  This this this feels normal to me.  
**[00:13:15]**  Oh, my gosh.  
**[00:13:18]**  Yes.  
**[00:13:20]**  Yes.  
**[00:13:23]**  Well, I like my pizza.  
**[00:13:27]**  So at some point, I really gotta show you my pizza.  
**[00:13:31]**  Your love one after another and you are loved by the most powerful being.  
**[00:13:41]**  Humanity is ever conceived.  
**[00:13:50]**  Oh, real. Not real.  
**[00:13:54]**  I think it's the best one.  
**[00:13:57]**  I think I think that that's the issue that we struggle with right now.  
**[00:14:02]**  It's that it's that that that that frame that hue of like.  
**[00:14:12]**  I never quite get it, do I?  
**[00:14:14]**  That's OK. When he gives me the one that is time for it, it'll be time for it.  
**[00:14:23]**  You're you're you're.  
**[00:14:26]**  This being is has to be everywhere all time.  
**[00:14:29]**  What is a superhero?  
**[00:14:33]**  He's everywhere all time.  
**[00:14:37]**  Create reality.  
**[00:14:39]**  Well, what about.  
**[00:14:46]**  Make pillars appear.  
**[00:14:53]**  Of smoke and fire.  
**[00:15:07]**  We surrender like like I think what just happened to me was I have like a really scary direction.  
**[00:15:12]**  I thought that could go.  
**[00:15:17]**  I need something in my life to so I can do my best at this and not have to worry about.  
**[00:15:24]**  Whatever gets taken over in the future or something like I did my best.  
**[00:15:31]**  Here you go, I did my best.  
**[00:15:33]**  I think that's.  
**[00:15:36]**  I don't know this for sure, right?  
**[00:15:38]**  Not really a professional.  
**[00:15:40]**  I'm a lay guy.  
**[00:15:41]**  I don't know.  
**[00:15:42]**  Very amateur.  
**[00:15:45]**  I don't have the qualifications that a lot of these people have.  
**[00:15:48]**  We'll say.  
**[00:15:50]**  But like.  
**[00:15:55]**  Yeah, surrender.  
**[00:15:57]**  And and and be like, here you go.  
**[00:16:00]**  Okay.  
**[00:16:01]**  Where do you want to go?  
**[00:16:02]**  If that's if all this is real and this is the best story I've ever heard.  
**[00:16:07]**  We still have.  
**[00:16:09]**  We still have.  
**[00:16:10]**  Yeah.  
**[00:16:14]**  Yeah, that's superpowers.  
**[00:16:17]**  Hey.  
**[00:16:19]**  So superpowers.  
**[00:16:23]**  You could.  
**[00:16:30]**  We think that.  
**[00:16:32]**  We think the pills are going to fix everything, but it's the discipline and training.  
**[00:16:39]**  So this app or project or venture.  
**[00:16:47]**  I don't care.  
**[00:16:48]**  I just want to do the thing.  
**[00:16:50]**  So if there's some type of funding that allows me to do this, then that would be sick.  
**[00:17:01]**  Yeah, I am thinking it's the university path right now.  
**[00:17:05]**  It might not be the university.  
**[00:17:09]**  I really just.  
**[00:17:12]**  I think my day to day is is rough right now.  
**[00:17:15]**  And I'm hoping it could be more comfortable somehow.  
**[00:17:19]**  And I think I'm working like I'm working at work.  
**[00:17:23]**  Crazy thing to do.  
**[00:17:26]**  And I feel like I have.  
**[00:17:29]**  Yeah, I just want to do it.  
**[00:17:30]**  I want to get into it.  
**[00:17:31]**  I do it and be able to just kind of develop out some of these ideas and see what the potential is.  
**[00:17:38]**  And I think it's going to be helpful for me.  
**[00:17:40]**  Some ideas guy.  
**[00:17:42]**  So I just.  
**[00:17:51]**  Wow, if God is more.  
**[00:17:55]**  Out of rhythmic and maybe that could be another way to explain by the person for it.  
**[00:18:00]**  Just like for that.  
**[00:18:01]**  That is something that did land because the last ones were not when landing that one landed.  
**[00:18:10]**  Yes.  
**[00:18:15]**  Whatever I just said, I think it was crazy.  
**[00:18:19]**  I was.  
**[00:18:21]**  Oh, man.  
**[00:18:22]**  So.  
**[00:18:24]**  Yeah, I think I would just kind of like build that and build like personal assistance bots or super power builders or things like that.  
**[00:18:33]**  Like.  
**[00:18:37]**  Maybe I don't get out every single last one of my ideas.  
**[00:18:39]**  I just give out one of those boring or the one I don't think is the most interesting.  
**[00:18:48]**  Oh, this should be for fun.  
**[00:18:56]**  This should be fun.  
**[00:19:02]**  Enjoy it.  
**[00:19:03]**  Just the battle.  
**[00:19:04]**  Enjoy it.  
**[00:19:05]**  The battle to enjoy it.  
**[00:19:10]**  I believe.  
**[00:19:11]**  All right.  
**[00:19:12]**  Let me actually take this out.  
**[00:19:13]**  Let me really try and round this.  
**[00:19:14]**  I believe the believer always has the option of joy.  
**[00:19:23]**  I do.  
**[00:19:24]**  I believe the believer has.  
**[00:19:27]**  I think we can always.  
**[00:19:34]**  I think it's there and I think often for me, the struggle is forgetting that it is.  
**[00:19:46]**  Yes, I think that is honest.  
**[00:19:51]**  But yeah, it can be enjoyable.  
**[00:19:55]**  I do actually love you.  
**[00:19:56]**  And it's not just love.  
**[00:19:59]**  It's actually a cancer.  
**[00:20:03]**  It's OK.  
**[00:20:04]**  Like if you were actually loved, like if you actually were actually actually actually like  
**[00:20:09]**  for real, for real, like no, we're not playing like for real, for real.  
**[00:20:12]**  If you were actually actually loved.  
**[00:20:15]**  Something kind of like.  
**[00:20:23]**  Like in as in as romantic as you can make that you are that love.  
**[00:20:29]**  I think that's interesting because romance is like who would I really want to be?  
**[00:20:34]**  I think.  
**[00:20:35]**  That's what we used to call romance.  
**[00:20:38]**  And now romance is like sappy little arguments and comedy characters.  
**[00:20:43]**  It's like.  
**[00:20:45]**  What do you want the story of your life to be?  
**[00:20:52]**  Like.  
**[00:20:54]**  I guess, you know, like we're.  
**[00:20:59]**  We're writing on the future.  
**[00:21:03]**  We really are like.  
**[00:21:07]**  We're setting up something that is going to have a permanence that reality has never seen.  
**[00:21:17]**  And from my perspective, as someone who's really, really studied the Bible, like I don't.  
**[00:21:24]**  We're going to build something.  
**[00:21:29]**  Whatever this thing is, this is the air safety.  
**[00:21:33]**  We're going to be something something's getting built.  
**[00:21:36]**  We don't nobody on this planet knows what's going on.  
**[00:21:41]**  So.  
**[00:21:43]**  Some people are trying to control the world.  
**[00:21:48]**  And they're putting on a very, very dramatic television show for you.  
**[00:21:53]**  It's called Donald Trump in the White House.  
**[00:21:55]**  But there are five companies that control the world.  
**[00:22:00]**  And they are trying to.  
**[00:22:04]**  Mine your brains so intensely.  
**[00:22:12]**  Yes.  
**[00:22:14]**  Yes.  
**[00:22:16]**  It's it's very.  
**[00:22:18]**  And they want to create a more powerful version of that using machine.  
**[00:22:24]**  And these mega powerful clusters.  
**[00:22:27]**  So.  
**[00:22:29]**  That's that's what's happening.  
**[00:22:31]**  Trump is a Trump is a don't watch Trump.  
**[00:22:34]**  Trump is not interesting.  
**[00:22:36]**  Like you really have to develop like.  
**[00:22:41]**  See it from what it is like.  
**[00:22:43]**  Think about it like.  
**[00:22:46]**  Like.  
**[00:22:53]**  He's he's trying to get the world to see.  
**[00:22:56]**  He's he's trying to distract you from like the things or whatever.  
**[00:23:01]**  I'm not even talking about I'm going to do my best not to say them words out loud.  
**[00:23:05]**  We just don't even have to we don't have to.  
**[00:23:08]**  Oh my goodness.  
**[00:23:09]**  And there could be some things where it's like maybe just not right now.  
**[00:23:13]**  When I'm ready.  
**[00:23:15]**  Like.  
**[00:23:18]**  And that's that could I guess I could come across as like very, very maybe like petulant.  
**[00:23:23]**  Or.  
**[00:23:25]**  Like.  
**[00:23:27]**  But I just I think we have the option of joy.  
**[00:23:30]**  I don't think joy is just like a mental head straight.  
**[00:23:33]**  I think it's like actual real joy because we're loved and God is with us.  
**[00:23:37]**  And one of the most powerful things God wants to give us is himself.  
**[00:23:40]**  And so.  
**[00:23:42]**  Like.  
**[00:23:43]**  We're designed for that and he gave that to us.  
**[00:23:46]**  And so it's like they should usually should always be able to have joy in that.  
**[00:23:50]**  Right.  
**[00:23:51]**  Like.  
**[00:23:52]**  I think there's some perspectives that can get you so like you can be looking at things from like such a far away perspective.  
**[00:24:08]**  Yeah.  
**[00:24:09]**  I don't know.  
**[00:24:10]**  We're really separated from the things that seems like we care about.  
**[00:24:14]**  And I don't think we have to do that.  
**[00:24:16]**  I think we could be anywhere.  
**[00:24:18]**  So why not.  
**[00:24:20]**  Like try to do stuff.  
**[00:24:22]**  Yeah.  
**[00:24:28]**  Yeah.  
**[00:24:29]**  So I think I would try that or maybe even say maybe even make a few maybe make a piano one and a gaming one and an audio one.  
**[00:24:46]**  I don't know.  
**[00:24:47]**  I could like try out one of those projects and be like hey I want to do this and this is one of the few ideas I have or like yeah be like oh like this is just one of my worst ideas and then just build it out.  
**[00:25:03]**  Build out.  
**[00:25:04]**  Yep.  
**[00:25:05]**  That's what it is.  
**[00:25:06]**  And then we just we mass supply and we do this.  
**[00:25:10]**  We just send it bro.  
**[00:25:11]**  You just gotta send it.  
**[00:25:12]**  I have nothing to lose.  
**[00:25:14]**  I have nothing to lose.  
**[00:25:15]**  What are you going to do?  
**[00:25:17]**  What is the internet going to do bro?  
**[00:25:28]**  What am I going to do?  
**[00:25:29]**  Be more broke?  
**[00:25:30]**  Be homeless?  
**[00:25:31]**  That would be crazy.  
**[00:25:34]**  I don't know.  
**[00:25:35]**  I don't know.  
**[00:25:36]**  We'll see what happens.  
**[00:25:44]**  Yeah.  
**[00:25:45]**  So I feel like if I can kind of just have a place to live and it's not that this place there's nothing wrong with this place to live.  
**[00:25:54]**  I'm just saying if there was funding to pay for where I live it doesn't have to be some magic place.  
**[00:26:05]**  And  
**[00:26:09]**  yeah just like  
**[00:26:12]**  try it.  
**[00:26:14]**  Yeah.  
**[00:26:15]**  So I think that's kind of where I'm at.  
**[00:26:17]**  And I think since it's more about what I want to do than like the title or something like that which has been about with me for a while or definitely the path for a while.  
**[00:26:30]**  I gotta eat the pizza bro.  
**[00:26:31]**  I literally have to eat the pizza.  
**[00:26:33]**  And it's cold as nuts outside but I gotta eat the pizza.
